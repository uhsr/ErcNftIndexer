# ErcNftIndexer

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing a novel NFT fractionalization scheme using ERC-1155 tokens and a Merkle tree-based access control list for granular ownership and permission management.

## Features

- Indexes ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens from Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Chain using optimized event listeners.
- Stores NFT metadata and ownership information in a PostgreSQL database with JSONB columns for flexible schema.
- Provides a GraphQL API endpoint for querying NFTs based on contract address, token ID, owner, and metadata attributes.
- Implements a caching layer using Redis to minimize database load and improve query performance.
- Supports real-time NFT transfer and minting updates via WebSockets for client-side applications.
- Utilizes a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to decouple event processing from the API layer for scalability.
- Deploys with Docker and Kubernetes for easy deployment and scaling in cloud environments.
- Integrates with IPFS and decentralized storage solutions to retrieve and cache NFT media assets.
